# Introduction

<b>This is a classic game of Connect Four. I programmed it during my service in the Education Corps, but it wasn't used in an educational software, so it is only a demonstration of the game itself without considering design, user experience, and other tools that go into an educational software. The game was programmed using Flash Builder and Adobe Animate.</b>

# How to play

2 Players take turns placing discs into the grid until one player has a row of 4 of his or her discs in a row. 
In terms of the game I made, the player can only choose a column (as long as there is an empty space in it) 
and the disc will automatically fall in that column to the empty space closest to the bottom of the grid - just like in the physical game.

The row can be up and down (vertical), across (horizontal), or diagonal.

The first player to make any kind of row wins the game.

<b>To play it yourselves, you need to download the additional file in this repository, "Connect4.exe". Enjoy playing!</b>
